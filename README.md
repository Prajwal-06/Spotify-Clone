# Spotify-Clone
As part of learning to code,I completed a project that involved creating a basic Spotify clone using HTML and CSS. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface.I also gained experience working with version control tools such as Git and GitHub.
